=Description=

The course covers the basic principles of database systems as seen by users, application programmers and database administrators.
A laboratory assignment develops these topics as a running example throughout the course.
These include programming in SQL, as seen by a user querying or modifying an existing database, by a database designer,
and by an application programmer invoking SQL from a host language.
Course contents include:
- Entity-Relationship modelling
- Functional Dependencies and Normalisation
- Database querying and manipulation through SQL
- Interfacing to a database from a host language (Java/JDBC)
- The semi-structured model, XML


The course is thus a typical first course in database systems, and occupies a traditional place in the curriculum.

=Laboration times and supervision=

See [Time Edit https://se.timeedit.net/web/chalmers/db1/public/ri1X50gQ2560YvQQ05Z6278Y0Zy6007311Y54Q085.html]
for times and places.

Course assistants will be in the lab rooms to help.

**Attendance in these classes is optional**.
Normally, each student should attend **at most one** supervised laboration time each week.
Since attendance is not compulsory, there may be room for more 
times. But, if there is lack of room, those who attend their first 
supervision of the week have priority to get a place and supervisor help.


=Assignments=

There are three assignments (a.k.a. "laborations", "labs"), written individually or in pairs. 
- deadline 1/2: Lab 1: Design
- deadline 19/2: Lab 2: implementation
- deadline 5/3: Lab 3: Java application


The specification ("lab PM") will appear [here ./lab]

Reporting is done via 
Fire (link forthcoming)
Before reporting assignments 1 and 2, you must run your program through a test suite.

**Final deadline is Saturday 13 March** for all returned and corrected labs.
No labs will be graded after this deadline.

We guarantee two gradings per lab: one for the version submitted before the
ordinary deadline for that lab, the other for a resubmission before
the final deadline. If your first submission is after the lab
deadline, only one grading is guaranteed.


=Literature=

The course book is

- Hector Garcia-Molina, Jeffrey D. Ullman, and Jennifer Widom,
  //Database Systems: The Complete Book, 2/E//,
  Pearson Education,
  2008.


[Book web page http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Database-Systems-Pearson-New-International-Edition-The-Complete-Book-2E/9781292024479.page]

A new "international edition" was published in summer 2013.
The chapters relevant to this course are the same, so either version will be OK.
The book is available at Cremona and at web bookshops.




=Exercises=

There are six exercise sessions.
Each session is given two or three times; you are supposed to participate at most once at each session.

See [Time Edit https://se.timeedit.net/web/chalmers/db1/public/ri1X50gQ2560YvQQ05Z6278Y0Zy6007311Y54Q085.html]
for exact times and places.

The questions are based on [last year's questions http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2016/course/TDA357/HT2016/tutorials/index.html]

but will be confirmed a week before each class:


=Exam=
