<H1>Purpose</H1>

<P>
The purpose of this assignment is to give you hands-on experience with
designing, constructing and using a database for a real-world-like domain. You will
see all aspects of database creation, from understanding the domain to using
the final database from external applications.
</P>

<A NAME="toc2"></A>
<H1>Assignment submission and deadlines</H1>

<P>
To pass the programming assignment, you must pass all five tasks described on
this page. You will do the assignment in groups of two.
</P>
<P>
You must submit your solutions through the
<A HREF="https://databases-lp3-18.frs.cse.chalmers.se/">Fire</A> reporting system.
</P>
<P>
You must submit your group's solutions to each task by the given
deadline, which are given on the <A HREF="../index.html">course web page</A>.
After submission, your assignment will be graded ("pass" or "reject") and you
will receive comments on your solution (for tasks 1, 2, and 3). If your
submission is rejected, you are allowed to refine your solution and re-submit
it. There will be set of automated test to preliminarily grade your assignment.
</P>
<P>
To pass the final part of the assignment, you must demonstrate your system to
one of the teachers. Your files for task 4 must be uploaded to the Fire system
<B>after</B> you have demonstrated your system, and <B>before</B> the task 4
deadline.
</P>

<A NAME="toc3"></A>
<H1>Introduction</H1>

<P>
In this assignment you will design and construct a database, together with a
front end application, that handles university students and courses. You will
do this in four distinct tasks:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Construction: create the database and explore it with queries
<LI>Design: take a step back and redesign the database from a more theoretical point of view
<LI>Usage: define more constraints and triggers to maintain the database
<LI>Interface: write a wrapper program to permit database access without explicit use of SQL
</OL>

<P>
All of the tasks are related to each other.
They deal with the same database, and tasks 3 an 4 build on task 1.
Task 2 is an independent analysis and sanity check on task 1.
(In previous years, the Design task 2 was made before the Construction task 1.
We have swapped the order for two reasons:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>design is more theoretical activity than construction, and hard to understand completely without prior practice
<LI>construction on a common schema, rather than everyone's own design, permits more substantial automated checking than before
</UL>

<P>
For each task you will hand in and get feedback on your results. Since
errors in one task may propagate to the next one, it is wise to hand in
your solutions early to get more chances for feedback.
</P>
<P>
Be sure to read through the full description of the assignment before
you start since the requirements we place on the system must influence
your initial design as well.
</P>

<A NAME="toc4"></A>
<H1>Domain description</H1>

<P>
The domain that you will model in this assignment is that of courses and
students at a university. So as not to make the task too large and
unspecified, you will here get a description of the domain that
restricts the problem somewhat. Note that the described domain is not
identical to Chalmers or GU.
</P>
<P>
The university for which you are building this system is organized into
departments for employees, such as the Dept. of Computing Science (CS),
and study programmes for students, such as the Computer Science and
Engineering programme (CSEP). Programmes are hosted by departments, but
several departments may collaborate on a programme, which is the case
with CSEP that is co-hosted by the CS department and the Department of
Computer Engineering (CE). Department names and abbreviations are
unique, as are programme names but not necessarily abbreviations.
</P>
<P>
Each study programme is further divided into branches, for example CSEP
has branches Computer Languages, Algorithms, Software Engineering etc.
Note that branch names are unique within a given programme, but not
necessarily across several programmes. For instance, both CSEP and a
programme in Automation Technology could have a branch called
Interaction Design. For each study programme, there are mandatory
courses. For each branch, there are additional mandatory courses that
the students taking that branch must read. Branches also name a set of
recommended courses from which all students taking that branch must read
a certain amount to fulfill the requirements of graduation, see below.
</P>
<P>
A student always belongs to a programme. Students must pick a single
branch within that programme, and fulfill its graduation requirements,
in order to graduate. Typically students choose which branch to take in
their fourth year, which means that students who are in the early parts
of their studies may not yet belong to any branch.
</P>
<P>
Courses are given by a department (e.g. CS gives the Databases course),
and may be read by students reading any study programme. Some courses
may be mandatory for certain programmes, but not so for others. Students
get credits for passing courses, the exact number may vary between
courses (but all students get the same number of credits for the same
course). Some, but not all, courses have a restriction on the number of
students that may take the course at the same time. Courses can be
classified as being mathematical courses, research courses or seminar
courses. Not all courses need to be classified, and some courses may
have more than one classification. The university will occasionally
introduce other classifications. Some courses have prerequisites, i.e.
other courses that must be read before a student is allowed to register
to it.
</P>
<P>
Students need to register for courses in order to read them. To be
allowed to register, the student must first fulfill all prerequisites
for the course. It should not be possible for a student to register to a
course unless the prerequisite courses are already passed. It should not
be possible for a student to register for a course which they have
already passed.
</P>
<P>
If a course becomes full, subsequent registering students are put on a
waiting list. If one of the previously registered students decides to
drop out, such that there is an open slot on the course, that slot is
given to the student who has waited the longest. When the course is
finished, all students are graded on a scale of 'U', '3', '4', '5'.
Getting a 'U' means the student has not passed the course, while the
other grades denote various degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
A study administrator can override both course prerequisite requirements
and size restrictions and add a student directly as registered to a
course. (Note: you will not implement any front end application for
study administrators, only for students. The database must still be able
to handle this situation.)
</P>
<P>
For a student to graduate there are a number of requirements she must
first fulfill. She must have passed (have at least grade 3) in all
mandatory courses of the study programme she belongs to, as well as the
mandatory courses of the particular branch that she must have chosen.
Also she must have passed at least 10 credits worth of courses among the
recommended courses for the branch. Furthermore she needs to have read
and passed (at least) 20 credits worth of courses classified as
mathematical courses, 10 credits worth of courses classified as research
courses, and one seminar course. Mandatory and recommended courses that
are also classified in some way are counted just like any other course.
As an example, if one of the mandatory courses of a programme is also a
seminar course, students of that programme will not be required to read
any more seminar courses.
</P>

<A NAME="toc5"></A>
<H1>System Specification</H1>

<P>
You will design and implement a database for the above domain, and a
front end application intended for students of the university. Through
the application they should be able to see their own information,
register to, and unregister from courses.
</P>
<P>
Formally, your application should have the following modes:
</P>
<P>
-  Info: Given a students national identification number, the system
   should provide
</P>
<P>
   -  the name of the student, the students national identification
      number and their university issued login name/ID (something
      similar to how the CID works for chalmers students)
   -  the programme and branch (if any) that the student is following.
   -  the courses that the student has read, along with the grade.
   -  the courses that the student is registered to.
   -  whether or not the student fulfills the requirements for
      graduation
</P>
<P>
-  Register: Given a student id number and a course code, the system
   should try to register the student for that course. If the course is
   full, the student should be placed in the waiting list for that
   course. If the student has already passed the course, or is already
   registered, or does not meet the prerequisites for the course, the
   registration should fail. The system should notify the student of the
   outcome of the attempted registration, and the reason for failure (if
   any).
-  Unregister: Given a student id number and a course code, the system
   should unregister the student from that course. If there are students
   waiting to be registered, and there is now room on the course, the
   one first in line should be registered for the course. The system
   should acknowledge the removed registration for the student. If the
   student is not registered to the course when trying to unregister,
   the system need not notify this, but no student from the waiting list
   (if applicable) should be promoted in that case.
</P>

<A NAME="toc6"></A>
<H1>Task 1: Constructing the database</H1>

<P>
Your task is to construct the database by implementing the database schema in a database engine
(PostgreSQL).
The schema is explained abstractly in this file:
<center>
<A HREF="./task1.txt">Abstract schema for database task 1</A>
</center>
</P>
<P>
You should implement the schema with <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statements that
</P>

<UL>
<LI>use exactly the given table and attribute names
<LI>express the same primary key, foreign key, and uniqueness constraints
<LI>use reasonable types (not expressed in the abstract schema, but should be obvious from the domain description)
<LI>no column may accept NULL values
</UL>

<P>
Thus you should create all tables, marking key and foreign key constraints in the
   process, and you should also insert checks that ensure that only valid data
   can be inserted in the database. Examples of invalid data would be the grade
   '6', or a course that takes a negative number of students.
</P>
<P>
When you have created the tables, you should fill the tables with example
   data. This can be time-consuming, but it is an important part of the
   development of a database. Having data in the database is crucial in order
   to properly verify that it behaves the way that you expect it to. You should
   fill the tables with enough data so that it is possible to test that your
   application can handle the various operations specified above. Just
   inserting tons of data is of no use if the data still doesn't test all parts
   of the database. Here is a (very) non-exhaustive list of data you will need
   to include:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>A handful of students, at least one of which fulfils the requirements for
     graduation and a couple that do not for different reasons.
<LI>A number of courses that test all of the various aspects a course.  This
     includes classifications, mandatory, recommended etc. You need at least
     three waiting students for two different (limited) courses.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Important:</B> When you insert data in the database, do it by writing the
   insert statements in a file that can then be executed.  This way you won't
   have to re-do all the work if there is something that you need to change
   with the table.
</P>
<P>
Since you know exactly what information your application will need from the
   database, in what forms, it is a good idea to write views that provide that
   information in a simple form. In a real setting, we would even ensure using
   privileges that the application <I>cannot</I> work with anything but these views.
   Unfortunately we cannot let you test working with privileges on the
   PostgreSQL machine we use, but we will still expect your application to
   adhere to the privileges we list.
</P>
<P>
Following the system specification, create these views:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>View: <CODE>StudentsFollowing(ssn,name,program,branch)</CODE>
       For all students, their basic information (name etc.), and the programme
       and branch (if any) they are following.
<LI>View: <CODE>FinishedCourses(ssn,name,courseCode,courseName,grade)</CODE>
       For all students, all finished courses, along with their names, grades
       (grade <CODE>'U'</CODE>, <CODE>'3'</CODE>, <CODE>'4'</CODE> or <CODE>'5'</CODE>) and number of
       credits. The type of the grade should be a character type,
       e.g. <CODE>TEXT</CODE>.
<LI>View: <CODE>Registrations(courseCode,courseName,ssn,studentName,status)</CODE>
       All registered and waiting students for all courses, along with their
       waiting status (<CODE>'registered'</CODE> or <CODE>'waiting'</CODE>).
<LI>View: <CODE>PassedCourses(ssn,courseCode,credits)</CODE>
       For all students, all passed courses, i.e. courses finished with a grade
       other than 'U', and the number of credits for those courses. This view
       is intended as a helper view towards the <CODE>PathToGraduation</CODE> view (and
       for task 4), and will not be directly used by your application.
<LI>View: <CODE>UnreadMandatory(ssn,courseCode)</CODE>
       For all students, the mandatory courses (branch and programme) they have
       not yet passed. This view is intended as a helper view towards the
       <CODE>PathToGraduation</CODE> view, and will not be directly used by your
       application.
<LI>View: <CODE>PathToGraduation(ssn,name,creditsTaken,coursesToTake,creditsMath,creditsResearch,seminarsRead,status)</CODE>
       For all students, their path to graduation, i.e. a view with columns for
       -  <CODE>creditsTaken</CODE>: the number of credits they have taken.
       -  <CODE>coursesToTake</CODE>: the number of mandatory courses they have yet to read (branch
          or programme).
       -  <CODE>creditsMath</CODE>: the number of credits they have taken in courses that are
          classified as math courses.
       -  <CODE>creditsResearch</CODE>: the number of credits they have taken in courses that are
          classified as research courses.
       -  <CODE>seminarsRead</CODE>: the number of seminar courses they have read.
       -  <CODE>status</CODE>: whether or not they qualify for graduation. The
          SQL type of this field should be <CODE>BOOLEAN</CODE> (i.e. <CODE>TRUE</CODE> or <CODE>FALSE</CODE>).
</UL>

<P>
<B>Deliverables</B>: For task 1, you should submit the following files through Fire
</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>tables.sql</CODE>: your SQL code for creating the tables.
<LI><CODE>insert.sql</CODE>: your SQL code containing the insert statements for the data.
<LI><CODE>views.sql</CODE>: your SQL code for creating the listed views.
</UL>

<P>
  Note that SQL code should be in plain text format. Make sure that
    PostgreSQL can execute your files before you hand them in. Test this by
    clearing out your database and then running
    your SQL files again.
