<h2>Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this assignment is for you to get hands-on experience with
designing, constructing and using a database for a real-world domain. You will
see all aspects of database creation, from understanding the domain to using
the final database from external applications.</p>

<div class="toctree-wrapper compound">
</div>
<p>To pass the programming assignment, you must pass all five tasks described on
this page. You will do the assignment in groups of two.</p>
<p>You must submit your solutions through the Fire reporting system. Read the
separate notes on <a class="reference internal" href="submission.html"><span class="doc">registering in the Fire system, submitting assignment
tasks and requesting your group&#8217;s PostgreSQL account</span></a>.</p>
<p>You must submit your group&#8217;s solutions to each task by the given deadline.
After submission, your assignment will be graded (&#8220;pass&#8221; or &#8220;reject&#8221;) and you
will receive comments on your solution (for tasks 1, 2, 3 and 4). If your
submission is rejected, you are allowed to refine your solution and re-submit
it.</p>
<p>To pass the final part of the assignment, you must demonstrate your system to
one of the teachers. Your files for task 5 must be uploaded to the Fire system
<strong>after</strong> you have demonstrated your system, and <strong>before</strong> the task 5
deadline.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this assignment you will design and construct a database, together with a
front end application, that handles university students and courses. You will
do this in five distinct tasks:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#task1"><span class="std std-ref">Task 1: Designing the database schema (I)</span></a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#task2"><span class="std std-ref">Task 2: Designing the database schema (II)</span></a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#task3"><span class="std std-ref">Task 3: Constructing the database (I)</span></a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#task4"><span class="std std-ref">Task 4: Constructing the database (II)</span></a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#task5"><span class="std std-ref">Task 5: Writing a front end application</span></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Each consecutive task will be based on the previous, so it is one single
assignment that you will do. It will not be possible to only do the
fifth task for instance, since you will then have no database to build
your application on.</p>
<p>For each task you will hand in and get feedback on your results. Since
errors in one task may propagate to the next one, it is wise to hand in
your solutions early to get more chances for feedback.</p>
<p>Be sure to read through the full description of the assignment before
you start since the requirements we place on the system must influence
your initial design as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="domain-description">
<h2>Domain description<a class="headerlink" href="#domain-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The domain that you will model in this assignment is that of courses and
students at a university. So as not to make the task too large and
unspecified, you will here get a description of the domain that
restricts the problem somewhat. Note that the described domain is not
identical to Chalmers or GU.</p>
<p>The university for which you are building this system is organized into
departments for employees, such as the Dept. of Computing Science (CS),
and study programmes for students, such as the Computer Science and
Engineering programme (CSEP). Programmes are hosted by departments, but
several departments may collaborate on a programme, which is the case
with CSEP that is co-hosted by the CS department and the Department of
Computer Engineering (CE). Department names and abbreviations are
unique, as are programme names but not necessarily abbreviations.</p>
<p>Each study programme is further divided into branches, for example CSEP
has branches Computer Languages, Algorithms, Software Engineering etc.
Note that branch names are unique within a given programme, but not
necessarily across several programmes. For instance, both CSEP and a
programme in Automation Technology could have a branch called
Interaction Design. For each study programme, there are mandatory
courses. For each branch, there are additional mandatory courses that
the students taking that branch must read. Branches also name a set of
recommended courses from which all students taking that branch must read
a certain amount to fulfill the requirements of graduation, see below.</p>
<p>A student always belongs to a programme. Students must pick a single
branch within that programme, and fulfill its graduation requirements,
in order to graduate. Typically students choose which branch to take in
their fourth year, which means that students who are in the early parts
of their studies may not yet belong to any branch.</p>
<p>Courses are given by a department (e.g. CS gives the Databases course),
and may be read by students reading any study programme. Some courses
may be mandatory for certain programmes, but not so for others. Students
get credits for passing courses, the exact number may vary between
courses (but all students get the same number of credits for the same
course). Some, but not all, courses have a restriction on the number of
students that may take the course at the same time. Courses can be
classified as being mathematical courses, research courses or seminar
courses. Not all courses need to be classified, and some courses may
have more than one classification. The university will occasionally
introduce other classifications. Some courses have prerequisites, i.e.
other courses that must be read before a student is allowed to register
to it.</p>
<p>Students need to register for courses in order to read them. To be
allowed to register, the student must first fulfill all prerequisites
for the course. It should not be possible for a student to register to a
course unless the prerequisite courses are already passed. It should not
be possible for a student to register for a course which they have
already passed.</p>
<p>If a course becomes full, subsequent registering students are put on a
waiting list. If one of the previously registered students decides to
drop out, such that there is an open slot on the course, that slot is
given to the student who has waited the longest. When the course is
finished, all students are graded on a scale of &#8216;U&#8217;, &#8216;3&#8217;, &#8216;4&#8217;, &#8216;5&#8217;.
Getting a &#8216;U&#8217; means the student has not passed the course, while the
other grades denote various degrees of success.</p>
<p>A study administrator can override both course prerequisite requirements
and size restrictions and add a student directly as registered to a
course. (Note: you will not implement any front end application for
study administrators, only for students. The database must still be able
to handle this situation.)</p>
<p>For a student to graduate there are a number of requirements she must
first fulfill. She must have passed (have at least grade 3) in all
mandatory courses of the study programme she belongs to, as well as the
mandatory courses of the particular branch that she must have chosen.
Also she must have passed at least 10 credits worth of courses among the
recommended courses for the branch. Furthermore she needs to have read
and passed (at least) 20 credits worth of courses classified as
mathematical courses, 10 credits worth of courses classified as research
courses, and one seminar course. Mandatory and recommended courses that
are also classified in some way are counted just like any other course.
As an example, if one of the mandatory courses of a programme is also a
seminar course, students of that programme will not be required to read
any more seminar courses.</p>

<div class="section" id="system-specification">
<h2>System Specification<a class="headerlink" href="#system-specification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You will design and implement a database for the above domain, and a
front end application intended for students of the university. Through
the application they should be able to see their own information,
register to, and unregister from courses.</p>
<p>Formally, your application should have the following modes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Info: Given a students national identification number, the system
should provide<ul>
<li>the name of the student, the students national identification
number and their university issued login name/ID (something
similar to how the CID works for chalmers students)</li>
<li>the programme and branch (if any) that the student is following.</li>
<li>the courses that the student has read, along with the grade.</li>
<li>the courses that the student is registered to.</li>
<li>whether or not the student fulfills the requirements for
graduation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Register: Given a student id number and a course code, the system
should try to register the student for that course. If the course is
full, the student should be placed in the waiting list for that
course. If the student has already passed the course, or is already
registered, or does not meet the prerequisites for the course, the
registration should fail. The system should notify the student of the
outcome of the attempted registration, and the reason for failure (if
any).</li>
<li>Unregister: Given a student id number and a course code, the system
should unregister the student from that course. If there are students
waiting to be registered, and there is now room on the course, the
one first in line should be registered for the course. The system
should acknowledge the removed registration for the student. If the
student is not registered to the course when trying to unregister,
the system need not notify this, but no student from the waiting list
(if applicable) should be promoted in that case.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your first task is to design the database that your application will
use. The goal of this task and the next is to reach a correct database
schema that could later be implemented in PostgreSQL.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You are to create an E/R diagram that correctly models the domain described
above. Hint: if your diagram does not contain (at least) one weak entity,
(at least) one ISA relationship, and (at least) one many-to-at-most-one
relationship, you have done something wrong. You can use any tool you like
for this task, as long as you hand in your solution as an image in one of
the formats <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.png</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.jpg</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.gif</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pdf</span></code>.

diagrams, and can export diagrams to image files, but using any other tool
is also OK.</li>
<li>When your E/R diagram is complete, you should translate it, using the
(mostly) mechanical translation rules (see <a class="reference download internal" href="../_downloads/Translation.pdf" download=""><code class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">this</span>

<p>Your second task is to ensure that the database correctly captures all
constraints of the domain, not just those induced by the translation of
your diagram, by the use of functional dependencies.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Identify the functional dependencies that you expect should hold for
the domain. Do this starting from the domain description and the set
of attributes in your schema from task 1. <strong>Do not only look for
functional dependencies in your relation schemas!</strong> If you do, then
any potential errors in your schema would not be caught, nor will you
find any extra contraints not already captured by the relational
structure! At least one such constraint exists in the domain. You
should <strong>always</strong> look for the functional dependencies in the domain
description. Remember to check for functional dependencies with
multiple attributes on the left-hand side of the arrow.</li>
<li>When you have found all interesting dependencies, they should
<strong>then</strong> be checked against the relations from task 1. For any
constraints not already captured by your relation schema, either<ul>
<li>add the extra constraint to your schema, or</li>
<li>argue why your schema should not capture the constraint (see e.g.
the difference between 3NF and BCNF for why not all constraints
can be captured).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Further, do the same for any constraints needed to handle cyclic
relationships in your diagram. Specifically, address the issue
concerning a student&#8217;s programme and branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of things you may want to consider when

<p>When your design of the database has been approved, the next task is to
construct the database by implementing the database schema in a database engine
(PostgreSQL).</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">You should create all tables, marking key and foreign key constraints in the
process, and you should also insert checks that ensure that only valid data
can be inserted in the database. Examples of invalid data would be the grade
&#8216;6&#8217;, or a course that takes a negative number of students.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When you have created the tables, you should fill the tables with example
data. This can be time-consuming, but it is an important part of the
development of a database. Having data in the database is crucial in order
to properly verify that it behaves the way that you expect it to. You should
fill the tables with enough data so that it is possible to test that your
application can handle the various operations specified above. Just
inserting tons of data is of no use if the data still doesn&#8217;t test all parts
of the database. Here is a (very) non-exhaustive list of data you will need
to include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A handful of students, at least one of which fulfils the requirements for
graduation and a couple that do not for different reasons.</li>
<li>A number of courses that test all of the various aspects a course.  This
includes classifications, mandatory, recommended etc. You need at least
three waiting students for two different (limited) courses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> When you insert data in the database, do it by writing the
insert statements in a file that can then be executed.  This way you won&#8217;t
have to re-do all the work if there is something that you need to change
with the table.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Since you know exactly what information your application will need from the
database, in what forms, it is a good idea to write views that provide that
information in a simple form. In a real setting, we would even ensure using
privileges that the application <em>cannot</em> work with anything but these views.
Unfortunately we cannot let you test working with privileges on the
PostgreSQL machine we use, but we will still expect your application to
adhere to the privileges we list.</p>
<p>Following the system specification, create these views:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>View: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">StudentsFollowing</span></code></dt>
<dd><p class="first last">For all students, their basic information (name etc.), and the programme

<p>When your tables and views are implemented correctly, the next task is to
create two triggers to handle some key issues in registration and
unregistration.  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-TRIGGER-EXAMPLE">Here</a> is a piece of code to get you
started on the first trigger. But first, you should define one more view that
can be used by your triggers, and your application in Task 4:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>View: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CourseQueuePositions</span></code></dt>
<dd>For all students who are in the queue for a course, the course code, the
student&#8217;s identification number, and the student&#8217;s current place in the
queue (the student who is first in a queue will have place &#8220;1&#8221; in that
queue, etc.).</dd>
</dl>
<p>When a student tries to register for a course, it is possible that the course
is already full, in which case the student should be put in the waiting list
for that course. When a student unregisters, it might be that there is now room
for some student who is in the waiting list, and who should then be registered
for the course instead. Such things are typically handled via triggers. You
should write two triggers that:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>when a student tries to register for a course that is full, that student is
added to the waiting list for the course. Be sure to check that the student
may actually register for the course before adding to either list, if it may
not you should raise an error (use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/plpgsql-errors-and-messages.html">RAISE EXCEPTION</a>).
Hint: There are several requirements for registration stated in the domain
description, and some implicit ones like that a student can not be both
waiting and registered for the same course at the same time.</li>
<li>when a student unregisters from a course if the student was properly
registered and not only on the waiting list, the first student (if any) in
the waiting list should be registered for the course instead.  Note: this
should only be done if there is actually room on the course (the course
might have been over-full due to an administrator overriding the restriction
and adding students directly).</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to write the triggers on the view <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Registrations</span></code> instead of on the
tables themselves (third bullet under task 3 above). (One reason for this is
that we &#8220;pretend&#8221; that you only have the privileges listed under Task 4, which
means you cannot insert data into, or delete data from, the underlying tables
directly. But even if we lift this restriction, there is another reason for not
defining these triggers on the underlying tables - can you figure out why?)</p>
<p><strong>Prepare test cases (in SQL) for testing both insertion and deletion to check
the triggers work. Make sure your test suite covers all the points listed under
task 5, that we will check the complete application for.</strong></p>

<li><code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">setup.sql</span></code>: SQL code that sets up your database for testing the

insert different data to make it easier to test the triggers).  We should
be able to test your triggers by executing files <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">setup.sql</span></code>,

<p>The last part of this assignment is to write an application that students can
use to communicate with your database. This application should be a Java
program that uses JDBC to connect to the PostgreSQL database to request and
insert the proper data.</p>
<p>To your help when writing your application we provide you with a stub file that
contains the code for connecting to PostgreSQL on the local system. It also
contains hooks for the three operating modes of the application, and this is
where you should insert your code. The idea is that you should not need to
focus so much on the pure Java parts of the application, but rather get
straight down to business with the database-interfacing code.</p>
<p>The stub file, <a class="reference download internal" href="../_downloads/StudentPortal.java" download=""><code class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">StudentPortal.java</span></code></a>, looks like this (the yellow
highlighting shows the part you need to edit):</p>

giving some student identification number as an argument (what exactly that is
depends on your design). This corresponds to the student &#8220;logging on&#8221; to the
portal. Once logged on, the student can choose one of the three modes
&#8220;Information&#8221;, &#8220;Register&#8221; or &#8220;Unregister&#8221;. If the first is chosen, all
information for that student should be printed.  Exactly what information must
be printed is given by the system requirements specified above. If one of the
latter modes are chosen, the student will be prompted for a course to register
to or unregister from, and the application should perform the requested
operation and print the result (success, failure).</p>
<p>The stub file above can be compiled and run as it is, only nothing will happen
in any of the modes. Your task is thus to fill in the actual logic of these
three tasks.</p>
<p>Running your application could look like this:</p>

<p>Note that the exact formatting is only a suggestion, you may choose to format
your output differently as long as you give the proper information back to the
user.</p>
<p>To get access to the PostgreSQL jdbc drivers from your application, you should
download it from <a class="reference external" href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org">https://jdbc.postgresql.org</a> and import it into your java
CLASSPATH.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can import the file into an Eclipse project if you are using
it.</p>
<p>Your student application should behave as if it has <strong>only</strong> the following
privileges:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SELECT</span> <span class="pre">ON</span> <span class="pre">Courses</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SELECT</span> <span class="pre">ON</span> <span class="pre">StudentsFollowing</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SELECT</span> <span class="pre">ON</span> <span class="pre">FinishedCourses</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SELECT</span> <span class="pre">ON</span> <span class="pre">Registrations</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SELECT</span> <span class="pre">ON</span> <span class="pre">CourseQueuePositions</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SELECT</span> <span class="pre">ON</span> <span class="pre">PathToGraduation</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">INSERT</span> <span class="pre">ON</span> <span class="pre">Registrations</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DELETE</span> <span class="pre">ON</span> <span class="pre">Registrations</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>We will check your submitted code to ensure that you adhere to these
privileges, even though we cannot get the system to enforce them automatically.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>For task 5 you should hand in</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The source code for your Java application <strong>but read below!</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the fifth task will not be corrected through the submission
system, even though you should still submit your source code. Instead
you should come to one of the supervision sessions and demonstrate your
running application, and we will accept or reject it on the spot
(pending the check of the submitted code for authority violations). As
you probably realize, if all of you wait until the last Friday we will
quite simply not have time for everyone, so come early!</p>
<p>Here is a list of what we will test your application for:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>List info for a student.</li>
<li>Register the student for an unrestricted course, and show that they end
up registered (show info again).</li>
<li>Register the same student for the same course again, and show that the
program doesn&#8217;t crash, and that the student gets an error message.</li>
<li>Unregister the student from the course, and then unregister again from
the same course. Show that the student is unregistered.</li>
<li>Register the student for a course that they don&#8217;t have the prerequisites
for, and show that the registration doesn&#8217;t go through.</li>
<li>Unregister the student from a restricted course that they are registered
to, and which has at least two students in the queue.  Register again to
the same course and show that the student gets the correct (last)
position in the waiting list.</li>
<li>Register, unregister and re-register the same student for the
same restricted course, and show that the student is first removed and
then ends up in the same position as before (last).</li>
<li>Finally, unregister a student from an <em>overfull</em> course, i.e. one with
more students registered than there are places on the course (you need
to set this situation up in the database directly). Show that no student
was moved from the queue to being registered as a result.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ensure that the data you have put into your system can handle all these
cases. Please prepare before you ask us to check your application, so
that running through these cases will be smooth. Please fill the following
form before demonstration (<a class="reference download internal" href="../_downloads/demo-form.pdf" download=""><code class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">demo</span> <span class="pre">form</span></code></a> )</p>
<p class="last"><strong>Students should demo their working project before or on the last lab session (2016-12-16)</strong></p>
