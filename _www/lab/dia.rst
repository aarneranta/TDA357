Dia
===

**Dia** is a diagram drawing program. If you want to use **dia** to draw
Entity-Relationship diagrams, these notes will help you to get started.

#. Start **dia** using the command :command:`dia`.

   If the "dia" command is not found, install it first.

#. Select the E/R modelling tools. To do this, use the drop-down menu in
   the "Dia v0.97" window (Other sheets → ER).

   To draw an:

   -  Entity: Select the E and place it.

   -  Weak entity: Select the E and place it. Double click on it and
      select "Weak".

   -  Relationship: Select R and place it.

   -  Supporting relationship (to a weak entity): Select R and place it.
      Double click on it and select "Identifying".

   -  Attribute: Select A and place it.

   -  Key attribute: Select A and place it. Double click on it and
      select "Key" or "Weak key".

   -  Isa: Select "Flowchart" from the drop down box where ER is
      selected (and "Assorted" was selected when you started dia).
      Select the triangle and place it. Observe that you do not have to
      double click (and can't) this triangle to change the label in it.

   -  Connecting arrow/line: Select the straight line in the upper tools
      box (not in the "ER"-tool box). Draw the line. Make sure both ends
      hooks in (becomes red). Double click on the arrow. Select the
      start and end arrow to match your needs. The default arrow is not
      the correct one for a "one relationship". It should be arrow
      number 4 from the top of the list. For an "exactly one" arrow it
      should be the arrow number 4 from the bottom of the list. The
      straight line is at the top.

#. To save your diagram right click on the diagram background and select
   File → Save as. To export it into for instance .png, right click on
   the diagram background and select File → Export. Remember that the
   only accepted formats on the lab hand-in are .png, .jpg, .gif and
   .pdf.
